# JetBrains Community Discord
The unofficial, community Discord server for JetBrains - The Python bot behind it

## Community Discord Server

We have an unofficial, community driven server on Discord for all users of JetBrains to hang out on.
The server has dedicated channels for each product that JetBrains produce as well as some key channels under the Open Source category for major open source projects run by JetBrains.
We also have quite a few JetBrains staff with us on the server, here to hang out and chat with us.

*This server is not a JetBrains official support channel, it is a community run server for the JetBrains community to chill in.*

## The Bot

This is the very poorly written bot that was used to set up the JetBrains server roles, channels and emotes for the Products and Open Source categories.
The bot makes use of Python 3.6 and discord.py rewrite to work.
I provide absolutely no support for this bot as it was written in a very messy style to get the job done.
Feel free to make pull requests to improve the quality of it.
